serials
=========

Serials aims to be a podcast-like experience for reading serial publications on the web. 

Many excellent books and webcomics are being published openly on the web today. Most of those are published one chapter at a time. It's awesome that authors are self-publishing, but this format makes it hard to keep track of your progress. 

The system will scan sources to create a table of contents for each book. It will notify subscribers, and keep track of their reading progress.
