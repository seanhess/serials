Webfiction Privacy Policy
=========================

> Your privacy is genuinely important to us. Here's how we manage and use your data.

We take protecting your privacy seriously, and we want you to understand exactly how and why we use your information. This document is our Privacy Policy, which describes what information we collect and what it's used for. It applies to all interactions with webfiction.

 Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with webfiction will constitute your agreement to our policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use our services. Additionally, our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) is part of our [User Agreement](./user-agreement.md), and by using webfiction you agree to both.

About this policy
-----------------

Webfiction is an application that allows you to find and read books published on the web. We collect some information in order for you to have an account you can use to participate on the site, and other information that is necessary to make the service work. We don’t sell or profit from the information you share with us.

What information we collect
---------------------------

When you create an account, you are required to provide an email and password. You may include a first and last name as well.

#### Log Data

Log data is certain information that is automatically collected by our systems when you visit webfiction, including the type of software used to access the site (browser, operating system), the type of device you are using, the address of the external or internal page that referred you, and your IP address. This information is recorded for all visitors and is only linked to your account if you are signed in.

#### Activity Information

We collect information about how all visitors browse the site to make webfiction better. This information is aggregated and personally identifiable information will be removed.

#### Other information related to your account

When you are logged into your webfiction account, we save the following information about your preferences and your interactions with the site to allow you to customize your experience: subscriptions, read / unread chapters, comments, preferred language, all languages you see content in, and the date of last login.


How we use or disclose collected information
--------------------------------------------

#### Our use of your information is limited to improving your experience

All information used is intended to enable the features provided by the app, investigate bugs, or to understand and improve the user interface.

#### Your private information is never for sale

This means that we will only share your personal data with your consent, and after letting you know what information will be shared and with whom, unless it is otherwise permitted in this policy.

Anonymous, aggregated information that cannot be linked back to an individual user may be made available to third parties.

#### Webfiction will not disclose your information unless required by law

We may disclose – or preserve for future disclosure – your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are going to release your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance via email unless we are prohibited by court order from doing so (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)). We reserve the right to delay notice to users in cases involving the exploitation of minors and when we believe a delay is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.

Cookie Policy
-------------

#### Technologies we use

Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by websites you visit in order to help them remember certain information about you. At webfiction, we set only a few cookies for tracking user preferences, authentication, and collecting anonymous analytics data. We also use pixel trackers, which are images embedded in a webpage, for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Each of these uses is described in greater detail below.

#### Authentication cookies

When you log into your account, webfiction will place a cookie for the sole purpose of creating this session. It contains your user id and hashed authentication information.

#### Analytics cookies

We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our website. It tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as how the site was accessed, how long visitors stayed, and the number of first-time visitors to the site. To learn more about Google Analytics and how it uses your data, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.

#### disabling cookies

Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones. However, if you do this, portions of the webfiction website may not function as intended.

Email communications
--------------------

When you sign up for webfiction or contact support, webfiction may use a third party service to send you email messages. Only your email address will be stored with the third party service.

During early access, signing up for webfiction also signs you up for a simple newsletter notifying you of updates or asking for feedback. We will keep these messages to a minimum. We will always make it easy to opt out of our subscription emails, for example, by including a 1-click unsubscribe link.

Data security
-------------

Webfiction will make every effort to secure any private information submitted to us by our users. We use modern security and encryption. Your password is never stored on our servers, and we cannot retreive it for you. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as carefully maintaining the secrecy of your password).

Changes to this policy
----------------------

We reserve the right to change this policy to meet the changing needs of webfiction, or for any other reason. If we make changes, we will notify our users. Where the changes substantially alter your rights, notice will appear prominently on your front page. More minor changes may only be highlighted at the top of this agreement.
