Content
-------

Webficiton includes a library of web books and their chapters. All books are the property of the author, and art the property of the artist.

### Submiting Content

You can submit new books to webfiction. These should be fiction books published openly on the web for the purpose of entertaining readers. These books may be for-profit or free, but they should be publicly available without any login or paywall.

When you submit content it will be reviewed by an administrator or moderator prior to being published.

### Improving the library

All content added should improve the usefulness and value of the library to the community of users.

### Featured content

Not all content will be presented in the same manner. We intend to allow any book to be added to the site. But we also intend to curate books in some way. Access to curated books may be significantly better.

### Credit and permission

Make sure to add links to the author and artist to credit them for their hard work. Favor patreon or a home page with a donation button where available.

Because we are reproducing art on the site, please either submit your own art, or ask permission of the artist first.

### Infringement, Opting Out

If you are an author or artist and feel that your intellectual property is being infringed, please contact us and we will take it down. We want to support your work, and we will accomodate your wishes where possible.

We feel that webfiction falls squarely under fair use, but if you with to opt-out, let us know. If you opt-out, we will notify users that you have opted out so they do not attempt to add the book again.

### Moderator

If you are an author, let us know and we will make you a moderator of your book so you can make changes without review.
