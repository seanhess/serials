      <p>Serials is a podcast-like experience for reading serial publications on the web.</p>

      <p>Many excellent books and webcomics are being published openly on the web today. Most of those are published one chapter at a time. It's awesome that authors are self-publishing, but this format can make it hard to keep track of your progress.</p>

      <p>Serials lets you subscribe to your favorite works, keep track of your progress, and receive notifications when new content is published</p>
